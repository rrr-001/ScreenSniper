# local_config.pri.example
# Copy this file to `local_config.pri` and edit to match your machine.
# Then keep `local_config.pri` uncommitted (it's already in .gitignore).

# macOS (Homebrew) example:
# Uncomment and adjust if you installed tesseract and/or OpenCV via Homebrew
#
# macx: {
#    DEFINES += USE_TESSERACT
#    INCLUDEPATH += /opt/homebrew/include
#    LIBS += -L/opt/homebrew/lib -ltesseract -lleptonica
#    INCLUDEPATH += /opt/homebrew/opt/opencv/include/opencv4
#    LIBS += -L/opt/homebrew/opt/opencv/lib -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_videoio
# }

# Windows example (adjust paths to your Tesseract/OPENCV installs):
#
# win32: {
#    DEFINES += USE_TESSERACT
#    INCLUDEPATH += "C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/include"
#    LIBS += -L"C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/lib" -ltesseract51
#    INCLUDEPATH += "D:/C++/opencv/build/include"
#    LIBS += -L"D:/C++/opencv/build/x64/vc16/lib" -lopencv_world4120
# }

# Alternatively, set TESSDATA_PREFIX in your environment if tessdata is non-standard.
# Example (macOS zsh):
# export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/opt/homebrew/share/
